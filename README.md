## Synopsis

Our project provide a solution to visualize information about different platform of crowdlending investment.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

# External files

Some files are very special and we do not want that are on git "history" like the Config folder, we deleted from the git tree so we can change from branch to branch without incidents. Although these files 
are indispensable so we will have those files on another repository.
These files are Config, Vendor and tmp inside app and lib outside.

Vendor folder, it will be on app folder.
